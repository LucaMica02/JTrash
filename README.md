## Description

**JTrash** is a dynamic and engaging card game developed in Java. It uses the Java Swing library to provide a rich and interactive graphical user interface. The game is structured using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, ensuring a clear separation of concerns between the game's logic, user interface, and user input.

## Architecture

- **Model:** Manages the core game logic, including game state, rules, and data structures. It ensures consistency and handles internal operations.
- **View:** Provides the graphical user interface using Java Swing components, offering an interactive and visually appealing experience. It updates dynamically in response to changes in the model.
- **Controller:** Processes user input and coordinates interactions between the model and view. It updates the model based on user actions and refreshes the view accordingly.

The Observer-Observable pattern is employed to manage real-time updates and feedback. The model acts as the observable, notifying view components (observers) of changes, such as game state updates or player actions, to keep the user interface synchronized with the game's state.

## Features

- **Interactive UI:** Rich graphical interface built with Java Swing.
- **Dynamic Gameplay:** Play against up to 3 artificial players with adjustable difficulty levels.
