# JTrash
A card game developed with java In this application, I adopt the patterm MVC to sepate the responsabilities between the package. The comunication between the game class that is the brain of the application and the GUI is manage following the pattern Observer Observable. If you want to play have to download all the package that are in the src, and if you haven't a JVM you must install it. Every tip and contribution are appreciate :)
